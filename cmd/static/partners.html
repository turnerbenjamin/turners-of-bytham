        <h2>Our Partners</h2>
        <p>
          We are lucky to work with some very special businesses that enable us
          to do the things we do; providing the inspiration for us to grow new
          crops and find new ways to get the best from them once they leave the
          farm. So much of what we grow, from the “YQ” population wheats to the
          Naked Oats, have each come from a conversation started over a cup of
          tea at Tuxford’s windmill or Small Food’s café that begins: “How do we
          make this work?”

            <h3>Tuxford Windmill</h3>
            <p>
              Paul and Fari acquired their four-sail windmill in 2005, following
              its restoration by the Ostick family. They quickly moved this
              beautiful structure from museum-only condition to fully
              functioning windmill. Over the years they have developed the range
              of flours that they produce and throughout have remained committed
              to the principles of “Local First” both in sourcing their wheats
              and in the markets that they have nurtured.
            </p>
            <p>
              More recently, they have been joined by apprentice miller Nicki,
              who will ensure those unique skills and experience are carried
              forward to the next generation of millers. Many of the decisions
              that we make on the farm about the varieties we choose and the way
              in which we grow them are both informed and inspired by the small
              hive of industry that is Tuxford Mill.

            <h3>Small Food Bakery</h3>
            <p>
              Kim and her team bring the magic that transforms the wheat we grow
              into the stunning loaves and pastries for which they are renowned.
              The partnership between our farm, Tuxford Windmill and The Small
              Food Bakery is so much more than a simple, local food chain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through sharing our experiences of the crops, how they mill and
              how they bake, we quickly realised that conventional approaches to
              what constitutes a “good” milling wheat are simply a reflection of
              the constraints imposed by a particular industrial process.
              Artisan bakeries like Kim’s have no such constraints, being able
              to adapt their techniques batch-by batch to get the best out of
              what the grain can offer.

            <h3>Hodmedod</h3>
            <p>
              Nick, Josiah and William have helped to lead an astonishing
              rediscovery of British grains and pulses. Starting from their
              involvement in a study to explore ways in which a city like
              Norwich could be more self-sufficient in food production, Hodmedod
              is a wonderful example of what can be achieved given the necessary
              determination and belief to turn a vision into a reality.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alongside tried and trusted crops like Fava Beans, Hodmedod are
              supporting the development of a diverse range of food crops with a
              clear focus on their nutritional value. For many of these, turning
              them into a viable supply chain still depends upon developing
              varieties suitable to our climate or developing specialist
              machinery for harvesting or processing. For others, it is simply a
              matter of waiting for the markets to develop sufficiently to make
              them a commercially viable option.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are fortunate to work with the Hodmedod team in growing
              certified organic “Kabuki” Marrowfat Peas.

            <h3>E5 Bakehouse</h3>
            <p>
              Like The Small Food Bakery, the E5 Bakehouse is so much more than
              simply an artisan bakery. It is a direct link between the crops we
              grow and the those that support our way of farming through their
              choice of the flours, breads and pastries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Pioneers like Ben Mackinnon share with us a common determination
              to make simple, localised food systems not only work but flourish.
              They have in turn inspired others to follow and the growth in
              independent artisan bakeries in London in recent times is a joy to
              see.
