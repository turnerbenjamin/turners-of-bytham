        <h2>Our Family</h2>
        <p>
          Today’s farming life at The Grange continues to have real family
          involvement with John and Guy’s sister Jo running the farm office. The
          next generation of Sons, Daughters, Nieces and Nephews are also now to
          bringing their own diverse set of skills, which are so important for
          the next part of our journey, whether its Tom looking after our IT,
          Trudie with her artistic design skills, Jack with his steel forging
          work or Adam with his love of all things adventure! Our hope is that
          the future of farming at The Grange is one where the opportunity to be
          involved is far less constrained by the traditions of an inherited
          privilege and more one where a much broader range of skills,
          experience and inspiration can carry the farm along its next leg of
          the journey.

            <h3>John & Caroline</h3>
            <p>
              John’s family farmed at Skellingthorpe, near Lincoln, but as one
              of 13 children, he needed to take his farming ambitions away from
              home and under the watchful eye of his uncle Ruben Flint, came to
              work on the Holywell Estate. He soon met a local girl, Caroline,
              and had ambitions to be married, but to do so, he would need
              better prospects than his present work offered.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Grange was at the time part of the Holywell Estate and by
              chance a vacant tenancy arose. The diaries kept by John, in
              beautiful copperplate writing, detail his endeavours, many of
              which were recognised through the prizes he was clearly very proud
              to receive.

            <h4>1932</h4>
            <h3>John 'Jack' & Margaret</h3>
            <p>
              “Jack” began his professional career as a teacher before going on
              to work for the British Foreign Office. He worked in Khartoum at a
              time when Sudan was under a shared British and Egyptian
              administration, overseeing the use of precious water supplies to
              irrigate crops.
            </p>
            <p>
              A love of tropical agriculture and warm climates is something that
              would stay with Jack, including a number of years farming in
              Portugal during his retirement. However, the untimely failing of
              his father’s eyesight meant that his time in the Sudan was cut
              short and he returned home to help with what was now the family
              farm.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 1930s and immediate post-war period were challenging times for
              British farming, but Jack’s resourceful use of machinery and
              materials helped steer the farm through some of its most difficult
              times.

            <h3>Anthony & Judy</h3>
            <p>
              Following time spent in the RAF Regiment 'Rock Apes' as his
              National Service, Anthony returned to Little Bytham, taking on
              Sheepwash Farm and with just 5 cows, began the dairy herd that was
              to become the main focus for the family farm for the following 45
              years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Judy managed to juggle work as a supply teacher with the daily
              milking chores while at the same time raising their 4 children.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although retired, Anthony and Judy still live in the village, next
              door to Sheepwash Farm, and follow the farm’s changing patterns
              with the same keen interest.

            <h3>John & Guy</h3>
            <p>
              Brothers John and Guy have helped to steer the farm’s fortunes
              over the past 25 years – one that has taken an alternative path to
              the general trend yet one which has enabled us to stay true to the
              principles of good farming husbandry that the previous generations
              at The Grange strove to follow.
            </p>
            <p>
              The farm converted to organic principles in 1998, laying the
              foundations for so much of what the farm is able to do today. An
              ambitious scheme of tree and hedge planting was undertaken shortly
              afterwards, and a more formal 7-year crop rotation was introduced,
              which we still follow today.
