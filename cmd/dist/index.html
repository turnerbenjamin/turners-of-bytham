some, it is an important part of knowing where their food comes from
and the wider values that they are supporting. For others, it is a
chance to get to know the farmland whose trails they have enjoyed
exploring. So, whatever your reason for searching us out, thank you
and this is just a really small snapshot of what we do and the people
who help to make it all happen.<div class=quotation><blockquote>“Telling a story is like reaching into a granary full of wheat and
drawing out a handful. There is always more to tell than can be
told.”</blockquote><p class=citation>Wendell Berry</div><div class=section-separator><div class=rule></div><img src=img/jumping-hare.png><div class=rule></div></div></section><section id=grange-section class="text-img-block border-style yellow"><div class=text-img-block--img-wrapper><img src=img/grange-map.webp alt="map of The Grange"></div><div class=text-img-block--text-wrapper><div class=text-img-block--text><h3>The Grange</h3><p>The Grange is a traditional, organic farm cared for by the Turners
for over four generations. Tucked away in the small village of
Little Bytham near Stamford, the farm is able to produce some very
special crops from its small (by today’s standards) 100ha.<p>It sits overlooking a broad valley formed by the once great Bytham
River, whose legacy is its unique range of soils. John and Guy
continue the same long tradition of truly mixed, rotational
farming that has a passion for our produce.</div></div></section><section class="text-img-block reversed green"><div class="text-img-block--img-wrapper triangle-shadow right-aligned"><img src=img/lb5k.webp alt="lb5k competitors running on the farm"></div><div class=text-img-block--text-wrapper><div class=text-img-block--text><h3>Open Farm Everyday</h3><p>The farm has an extensive range of permissive footpaths, which
offer circular walks ranging from a short stroll to a full blown
hike. It’s a privilege to live on such a lovely farm and its one
that we like to share as widely as possible.<p>To protect the wildlife and farm animals, please stick to the
paths and keep dogs under close supervision.</div></div></section><section class="text-img-block blue"><div class="text-img-block--img-wrapper triangle-shadow"><img src=img/jackie-and-pete.webp alt="Jackie and Pete Murray"></div><div class=text-img-block--text-wrapper><div class=text-img-block--text><h3>Wildlife</h3><p>We are fortunate to have such a wide range of habitats to support
wildlife on the farm. Streams, ponds, a former clay pit, a disused
railway line and old limestone workings are all managed in ways to
make the most of what they can offer for insects, birds and
mammals.<p>Our Organic system of farming means that the food networks
necessary to support wildlife are interwoven with the areas we use
for producing crops and growing grass. Within the cereal fields
that grow the wheats and oats, you will also find plants that
would be easy to dismiss as simply “weeds” but they are as
important for feeding the wildlife as the crops are for feeding
us.<p>Every aspect of what we do at The Grange is a partnership, and
managing our wildlife is no exception. We are extremely fortunate
to have our very own dedicated “Grange Rangers” in the form of
Pete and Jackie Murray who make a huge contribution to what we do;
from an annual spring clean of the nesting boxes to monitoring our
butterfly and day moth populations.</div></div></section><section class="text-img-block banner-style offset yellow"><div class="text-img-block--img-wrapper large-screen-only"><img src=img/farm-group.webp alt="group visiting The Grange farm"></div><div class=text-img-block--text-wrapper><div class=text-img-block--text><h3>Our History</h3><p>There are reminders that farming has been practiced in Little
Bytham over many centuries. One of the suggested origins of the
village’s name “Bytham” comes from the Anglo-Saxon term
"cultivated village”. In medieval times, the land was sought by
the Earl of Albemarle, half-brother to William the Conqueror, “to
give him some land which would bear wheat, whereby he might be
better able to nourish his son”.</div></div></section></main><footer><a class=cta href=https://www.instagram.com/turnersofbytham/ target=_blank><h3>Follow Us</h3></a><div class=footer-links><a href=mailto:office@turnersofbytham.co.uk>OFFICE@TURNERSOFBYTHAM.CO.UK</a></div><div class=footer-attributions><p>© PM Images and Farming Photography<p>Design & Artwork by Trudy Turner Illustrations</div><img src=img/sitting-hare.svg alt=sitting-hare></footer>
